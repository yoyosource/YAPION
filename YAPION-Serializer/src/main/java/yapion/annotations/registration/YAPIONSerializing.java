/**
 * To load a generated Serializer for the annotated class you need to allow it in {@link GeneratedSerializerLoader} by
 * either allowing only the annotated class {@link GeneratedSerializerLoader#addClass(Class)} or the package and every
 * sub package {@link GeneratedSerializerLoader#addPackage(Package)}. This is a security measurement so that code
 * injections will only be done if directly stated in {@link GeneratedSerializerLoader}. If you specify a class
 * to allow loading of its generated Serializer you cannot undo this when it happened. It happens when you serialize or
 * deserialize any class annotated with this annotation and allowance by {@link GeneratedSerializerLoader}. You can
 * always allow more generated serializer to be loaded later on, by just adding them to {@link GeneratedSerializerLoader}.
 *
 * <br><br>Generator Rules
 * <br>- Act like a {@link YAPIONData} with no context
 * <br>- Allow removing specific fields with {@link YAPIONSaveExclude} and {@link YAPIONLoadExclude}
 * <br>- For evey field the {@link YAPIONOptimize} annotation will be considered
 * <br>- Any field marked static or transient will be ignored
 * <br>- Any field of super classes in the same compilation context will be considered
